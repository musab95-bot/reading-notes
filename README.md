 **In the reading 08 Comparison operators were introduced.**
It is used to compare between tow things in the script. There are different types of it. 
-If equal to
-If not equal
-Strict equal to 
-Strict not equal to 
-Greater than
-Smaller than
-Greater than or equal to 
-Less than or equal to

**Also types of logical operators like (and, or and not).**
- The process depends on what kind of process is met the conditions. If they are true or false. The result differs in each logical operator. 

**Then, loops were introduced**
- In loops if the results for the loop is still true, then it will continue. Else it will stop looping. There are different types of loop, For example, while, for, and do while. The different between for and while that in while you do not know the number of loops. Do while is similar to while loop. In writing any loop you need the loop name then condition counter in parenthesis. And then opening curly brace.  

**Finally** an example of while loop was introduced showing the loop will continue until the condition is met.
